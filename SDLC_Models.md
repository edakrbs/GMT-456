## V-Model 
Under the V-Model, the corresponding testing phase of the development phase is planned in parallel. So, there are Verification phases on one side of the ‘V’ and Validation phases on the other side. The Coding Phase joins the two sides of the V-Model.
   The following illustration depicts the different phases in a V-Model of the SDLC.
•	This is a highly-disciplined model and Phases are completed one at a time.
•	Simple and easy to understand and use.
•	Easy to manage due to the rigidity of the model.Each phase has specific deliverables and a review process.
•	V-shaped Model has higher chance of success over the waterfall model due to the development of test plans during the life cycle. It works well for small projects where requirements are easily understood.
•	Requirements have to be very clear before the project starts, because it is usually expensive to go back and make changes.
## Waterfall Model
In "The Waterfall" approach, the whole process of software development is divided into separate phases. In this Waterfall model, typically, the outcome of one phase acts as the input for the next phase sequentially.
   Waterfall Model Workflow:
•	Simple and easy to understand and use.
•	Easy to manage due to the rigidity of the model. Each phase has specific deliverables and a review process.
•	It works well for smaller projects where requirements are very well understood.
•	Phases are processed and completed one at a time.

## Spiral Model 
The spiral model has four phases. A software project repeatedly passes through these phases in iterations called Spirals.
